<h1>The Notary Project</h1>
<p>The Notary Project contains the specifications and tooling for implementing secure supply chain, which drives the Notary specification. The Notary Project is also the umbrella project for the Notary specification and Notation, its reference implementation.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Notary</h3>
<p>Notary is a <a href="https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signature-specification.md">specification</a> for signing and verifying container images and storing them as <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts">OCI artifacts</a> using <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/oci-conformance">OCI-conformant</a> registries. The latest version is Notary v2 which uses the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml">COSE signature envelope</a> and <a href='https://github.com/opencontainers/wg-reference-types/blob/main/docs/proposals/PROPOSAL_E.md'>OCI Reference Types</a>.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Notation</h3>
<p>Notation is a reference implementation of the Notary specification and has three components: <a href="https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go">a Notation Core Go library</a> for the core cryptography of signing and verifying, <a href="https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go">Notation Go library</a> that builds on the core go library and adds functionality such as pushing and pulling from registries, and <a href="https://github.com/notaryproject/notation">a CLI (<code>notation</code>)</a> that uses the go libraries to expose the full implementation.</p>
<p>In most cases, signing, verifying, and moving artifacts happens using <code>notation</code>.</p>
