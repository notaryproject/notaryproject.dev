  <h1>What is Notary?</h1>
  <p>Notary is a set of tools that helps you sign, store, and verify <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/artifacts">OCI artifacts</a> using <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/oci-conformance">OCI-conformant</a> registries.</p>

  <h1>Why use Notary?</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Sign, store, and verify any OCI artifact, including container images</li>
    <li>Signing and verifying uses public/private key verification</li>
    <li>Signing does not change the `@digest` or `artifact:tag` reference</li>
    <li>Signatures are portable across OCI-conformant registries</li>
    <li>Support for multiple signatures</li>
    <li>Designed to support multiple development flows</li>
  </ul>
