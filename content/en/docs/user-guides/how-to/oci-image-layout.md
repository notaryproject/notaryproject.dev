OCI image layout is a directory structure that contains files and folders that refer to an OCI image. OCI image layout is defined in [OCI image spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0-rc2/image-layout.md). Using OCI image layout, you can sign images on local disk before pushing them to the remote registry.

## Create OCI image layout for an image

Use `docker buildx build` with the `--output type=oci` flag to create an OCI image layout for an image.

For example, create a Dockerfile with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine
CMD echo 'hello world!'
```

Use `docker buildx create` and `docker buildx build` to create an OCI image layout for the image defined in the Dockerfile.

```console
docker buildx create --use
docker buildx build . -f Dockerfile -o type=oci,dest=hello-world.tar -t hello-world:v1
```

The above example sets `output=hello-world.tar` to save the OCI image layout as a tar file named `hello-world.tar`. To view the OCI image layout as a directory structure, extract the tar file.

```console
mkdir hello-world
tar -xf ./hello-world.tar -C hello-world
```

{{% alert title="Important" color="primary" %}}
You must extract the tar file before you can sign an image as an OCI image layout.

## Sign an image as an OCI image layout

To sign an existing image as an OCI image layout, enable the `NOTATION_EXPERIMENTAL` environment variable and use the `notation sign` command with the `--oci-layout` flag. The following example enables the `NOTATION_EXPERIMENTAL` environment variable, creates a self-signed certificate, and signs the image `hello-world:v1` as an OCI image layout.

```console
export NOTATION_EXPERIMENTAL=1
notation cert generate-test wabbit-networks.io --default
notation sign --oci-layout ./hello-world:v1
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Signatures are stored in the same OCI image layout directory, and associated with OCI image.
{{% /alert %}}

Use `notation list --oci-layout` to list signatures associated with an OCI image layout.

```shell
notation list --oci-layout ./hello-world:v1
```

## Verify an image as an OCI image layout

You can verify an image as an OCI image layout using `notation verify --scope` and setting `registryScopes` in your trust policy. For example, the following trust policy has `registryScopes` set to `local/hello-world`:

```json
{
 "version": "1.0",
 "trustPolicies": [
    {
         "name": "local-images-policy",
         "registryScopes": [ "local/hello-world" ],
         "signatureVerification": {
             "level" : "strict"
         },
         "trustStores": [ "ca:wabbit-networks.io" ],
         "trustedIdentities": [
             "*"
         ]
     }
 ]
}
```

The following command imports `permissive-trustpolicy.json`:

```console
notation policy import ./permissive-trustpolicy.json
```

Use `notation verify` with `--scope` set to the same value you set in your trust policy to verify the image against signatures:

```shell
notation verify --oci-layout ./hello-world:v1 --scope "local/hello-world"
```

## Push an OCI image layout to a remote registry

You can push an image to a remote registry as an OCI image layout on local disk using the [oras](https://oras.land/docs/CLI/installation) CLI. 

If you need a remote registry, you can create and run an OCI-compatible registry on your development computer using the [distribution/distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution) with the [image deletion](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#deleting-an-image) enabled. The following command creates a registry that is accessible at `localhost:5001`.

```console
docker run -d -p 5001:5000 -e REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true --name registry registry
```

Use `oras cp` to push the OCI image layout to the remote registry. For example:

```console
oras cp ./hello-world:v1 --from-oci-layout -r localhost:5001/hello-world:v1
```

{{% alert title="Important" color="primary" %}}
You must use the flag `-r` so that the signatures are copied together with the image.
{{% /alert %}}

Use `notation list` and `notation verify` to list and verify the image signatures. For example:

```console
notation list localhost:5001/hello-world:v1
notation verify localhost:5001/hello-world:v1
```
