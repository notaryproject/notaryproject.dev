Plugins for `notation` provide functionality and integration with key stores and signing services. For example:
- The [notation-azure-kv](https://github.com/Azure/notation-azure-kv) plugin allows you to sign a Notation-generated payload with a private key in [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview?wt.mc_id=azurelearn_inproduct_oss_notaryproject).
- The [AWS Signer plugin for Notation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/image-signing-prerequisites.html) lets you sign and verify images using Notation with keys and certificates managed by [AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html), a signing service.
- The [Venafi CodeSign Protect plugin for Notation](https://github.com/Venafi/notation-venafi-csp) enables the secure signing and verification of images using the [Venafi CodeSign Protect](https://venafi.com/codesign-protect/) platform.

## Install a plugin

To install a plugin, run the `notation plugin install` command to directly install a plugin either from a URL or from the host file system. This will create a `{plugin-name}` directory in `{NOTATION_LIBEXEC}/plugins/` if the directory does not exist. The supported plugin file formats are `.zip, .tar.gz` and `single plugin executable file`. Alternatively, if you are using an application that bundles a plugin and the `notation` binary together, such as [AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/image-signing-prerequisites.html), see the installation instructions from the vendor.

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Before creating the `{plugin-name}` directory, confirm you are using a name that follows the [naming structure](#plugin-naming-structure) for plugins. Plugins that do not follow the naming structure will not be recognized by `notation`.

```

## Uninstall a plugin
To uninstall a plugin, use `notation plugin uninstall`.

```console
notation plugin uninstall <plugin_name>
```

To confirm your plugin is uninstalled, run `notation plugin list`. For example:

```console
notation plugin list
```

## Plugin naming structure

The `notation` CLI strictly follows the [Notary Project specification for plugins](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/main/specs/plugin-extensibility.md#plugin-mechanism). This includes the naming structure for the plugin binary and the plugin directory. All plugins must be named `notation-{plugin-name}` and placed in the `{NOTATION_LIBEXEC}/plugins/{plugin-name}/` directory. Also, you can't modify the filename of the plugin binary from the `tar.gz` file when installing a plugin.

For example, the full path to the [notation-azure-kv](https://github.com/Azure/notation-azure-kv) plugin is `{NOTATION_LIBEXEC}/plugins/azure-kv/notation-azure-kv`.

If the plugin name or plugin directory does not match the naming structure or the plugin name is altered, `notation` will not recognize the plugin.

## Security best practices for plugins

Plugins are binaries that run on your host and can receive sensitive information from `notation` such as signatures, private keys, and payload data. As a result, it is strongly recommended that you follow these security best practices when using plugins:

- Ensure that you only download plugins and their checksums from known, trusted sources
- When available, use checksum verification or signature verification to confirm the plugin binary is not corrupted
