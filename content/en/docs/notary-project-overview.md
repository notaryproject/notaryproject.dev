## Introduction

The Notary Project is a set of specifications and tools intended to provide a cross-industry standard for securing software supply chains by using authentic container images and other OCI artifacts. Notation Project specifications and tooling provides signing and verification workflows for OCI artifacts, signature portability across OCI compliant registries, and integration with 3rd party key management solutions through a plugin model. Notary Project is also the name of the GitHub organization that has multiple prominent subprojects like Notation, Notary Project specifications, and Notary. Very often we use the name Notary Project to refer to all the above as well as the community that drives the specifications and the implementations. To learn more about Notary Project terms, please refer to the [FAQ](https://notaryproject.dev/docs/faq/#notary-project-terms).

Here is a list of repositories under the Notary Project organization

## Project status

The Notary Project is in active development. The latest release announcements are published on the [Notary Project blog](https://notaryproject.dev/blog/). The Notary Project community uses the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/notaryproject/projects/10) for project planning and status tracking. You can also use GitHub milestones to track the progress of each repository:

- [The Notary Project specification milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/milestones)
- [notation CLI milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/milestones)
- [notation-go library milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/milestones)
- [notation-core-go library milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go/milestones)
- [notary milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notary/milestones)

## Security

The Notary Project has a continuous fuzz testing implemented for the following repositories: `notary`, `notation-go`, and `notation-core-go`.

In addition, the Notary Project has had several public security audits:

- [Jul 7, 2023 by ADA Logics](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/v1.0.0/security/reports/audit/ADA-notation-security-audit-23.pdf) security audit covering `notation`, `notation-go`, and `notation-core-go` repositories.
- [Mar 21, 2023 by ADA Logics](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/v1.0.0/security/reports/fuzzing/ADA-fuzzing-audit-22-23.pdf) fuzz testing audit covering `notary`, `notation-go`, and `notation-core-go` repositories.
- [August 7, 2018 by Cure53](https://github.com/notaryproject/notary/blob/master/docs/resources/cure53_tuf_notary_audit_2018_08_07.pdf)) covering TUF and the `notary` repository.
