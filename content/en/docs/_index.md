The Notary project provides for multiple signatures of an [OCI Artifact][oci-artifacts], including container images, to be persisted in an [OCI conformant][oci-distribution-conformance] registry. The Notary project has several components including a collection of requirements and scenarios as well as CLI tools and libraries for implementing those requirements.
