The Notary Project maintainers are proud to announce new releases for its sub-projects, including [Notary Project specifications v1.1.0](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/releases/tag/v1.1.0), [notation v1.1.0](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.1.0), [notation-go v1.1.0](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.1.0), and [notation-core-go v1.0.2](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go/releases/tag/v1.0.2), [Notation GitHub Actions v1.0.1](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-action/releases/tag/v1.0.1) which are ready for production use! 

Meanwhile, a new library [notation-plugin-framework-go
](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-plugin-framework-go) released the first release v1.0.0. It contains framework required to create notation plugins as per [Notation Plugin specification](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/v1.1.0/specs/plugin-extensibility.md). 

## Notable Capabilities in this Release

Here are some of the major capabilities and features included in this release.

### Easier plugin management functionalities

Notation has an [extensible design based on a plugin framework](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/v1.1.0/specs/plugin-extensibility.md). This framework provides plugin interfaces for users and vendors to implement their own integration with key/certificate management solutions or signing services. 

In this release, Notation offers Notation plugin management capabilities to simplify the plugin user experience.  

- Added new command `notation plugin install`. Users are now able to install a notation plugin directly from a URL or from their file system. Supported plugin installation formats are `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, and single plugin executable file. See an example usage below:

```bash
$ notation plugin install --file <file_path>
```

```bash
$ notation plugin install --sha256sum <digest> --url <HTTPS_URL>
```

- Added new command `notation plugin uninstall`. Users are now able to uninstall a notation plugin by providing the plugin name. See an example usage below:

```bash
notation plugin uninstall <plugin_name>
```

The following plugins have been well tested with Notation plugin commands by Notary Project maintainers:

- [AWS Signer plugin for Notation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html)
- [Azure Key Vault for Notation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-sign-build-push)
- [Venafi CodeSign Protect Signing Plugin for Notation](https://github.com/Venafi/notation-venafi-csp)

### Specifications

For plugin vendors who want to package and distribute a Notation plugin,  [Notation Plugin specification](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/blob/v1.1.0/specs/plugin-extensibility.md) defines the plugin conventions to ensure plugins are delivered in a consistent format and compatible with `notation plugin` management commands.
