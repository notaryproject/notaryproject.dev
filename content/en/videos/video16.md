expanded_description: Recently we have seen challenges in the global consumer supply chain while the SolarWinds hack highlighted software supply chain weakness. The lack of software supply chain security has become a common attack vector for malicious code. When working with containers, it is important to ensure that processes are secure and controlled and be mindful that this is a multifaceted concern. While we can use a number of tools to scan for vulnerabilities, using digital signatures is a great way to ensure your code is exactly what is intended. Today, we will compare different options for signing container images and work through a demo using Notary, Gatekeeper, and Ratify. Notary is an open source project designed on TUF (The Update Framework) which is a specification for managing trusted application code. Gatekeeper is a customizable admission webhook for Kubernetes that enforces policies executed by the Open Policy Agent (OPA). Ratify is a workflow engine that coordinates the verification of different supply chain objects for an image as per a given policy. We will show how to use these technologies in a typical CI/CD process including enforcement by policy in Kubernetes clusters. Will the hacker be able to get malicious code deployed to our clusters? Tune in to find out!
