expanded_description: Notary v2 is a community project to solve the issues that the existing Notary project has that have hindered widespread adoption. The project is a community initiative with the main registry operators, including Docker, Microsoft and Amazon, as well as a broad community of other interested parties and end users. We will provide an overview of the state of the Notary v2 project to build registry native supply chain security for containers, and will show how it fits in with other supply chain initiatives that are being worked on. We will outline the road to production for Notary v2, and remaining work to do.
